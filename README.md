# Social-Network-Graph
Client work
______________________
Analyzing Twitter Social Networks for a client in Turkey. We explored a data set containing follows and followers to 
build a social following network. From here I was able to identify who the important indiviudals in Turkey, which 
could maximize sponsoship reach. 

Additionally, I identified the major cliques(groups of individuals) in the network, which helped the client map
and visually explore the data set uzing graphing applications.
